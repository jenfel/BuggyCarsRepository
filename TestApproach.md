# Test Approach for Buggy Cars Rating

## Introduction
This outlines the approach that will be taken to test Buggy Cars Rating. This provides an overview of the testing process and to define the scope, strategy, and objectives of the testing effort.

## Scope
- Functional testing: Ensuring that the application meets the requirements and performs as expected.
- Usability testing: Testing the application's ease of use and user interface.

*Given the time constraints, other testing types will not be done.*

## Test Strategy
- Manual: Testing will be performed against the live website: Functional and Usability of the website.
- Automation: Guided by the test pyramid concept, a small number of end-to-end (E2E) tests simulating real-world user interactions with the system under test will be automated to increase efficiency, reduce the risk of human error and catch defects that may arise when different parts of the system are integrated together.
- Risk-based testing: Testing efforts including listing of bugs will be prioritised based on the risks associated with each feature or function.

## Objectives
- To ensure that the application meets the requirements and performs as expected.
- To identify and report any bugs that could impact the application's usability
- To build user confidence by providing a high-quality, reliable application.

## Test Plan
- Test planning: Defining test objectives, test cases, and test data.
- Test design: Creating test scenarios and test cases based on the requirements.
- Test execution: Running tests, recording results, and reporting defects.
- Test closure: Evaluating the effectiveness of the testing effort and identifying areas for improvement.

## Test Environment
- Web browsers: Chrome, Electron
- Testing tools: Cypress, JavaScript
